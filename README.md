# Twilio-Message-Sending
Send Messages to Mobile through Twilio 

Python based Twilio Message Sending of data to mobile. 
The one i did on was for Corona Update in USA for the current date.

For message to send and receive, you would have to change the line containing "message = client.message.create(..".

Change from_= to the twilio number you get on account creation and change to= to the number you want to send the message on which is
verified by your Twilio account.

You have to use your acc id and authentication number for client creation. 
Look up twilio for better understanding.
